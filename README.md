# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

A simple machine learning project to predict whether a breast cell is **malignant** or **benign** using **Logistic Regression**.

---

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to:

- Load and explore the **Breast Cancer dataset**
- Train a **logistic regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Use the model to predict malignancy based on new measurements

The model can serve as a **supportive tool for early cancer diagnosis**, especially in hospital environments where quick analysis is helpful.
